# Mars Lessons

The first orbiter that NASA flew to Mars was the Mariner 4 in 1965. Mariner 4 took close-up images of the Red Planet and sent them back to Earth. The Viking 1 and Viking 2 landers were the second successful spacecraft and they arrived in 1976. Both landers collected science data from Mars’ surface and took images.

Since that time there have been quite a few successful spacecraft that have orbited, landed, and even roamed around the planet. Scientists have been focusing on the search for water on Mars. Water is one of the key ingredients for life to begin and thrive, so finding evidence of liquid water on any planet would mean that life might exist or have existed at one point.

The NASA rovers Spirit and Opportunity both found evidence that at one time in the history of Mars, water flowed. They found flood-paths on the surface that had not been covered by the massive dust storms, which also means that there was some form of liquid flowing and flooding surface areas more recently. The rovers also located minerals that can only form in water.

NASA sent the Mars Global Surveyor to orbit around Mars for nine years. During that time it mapped the surface of Mars in such detail that they could create a geological map. The orbiter also found that at one time, Mars had a magnetic field that was similar to Earth’s and that it shielded it from the deadly cosmic rays.

NASA has quite a few spacecraft that continue to orbit Mars and they use various scientific tools to collect data including information about the topography, climate, and the types of minerals found on Mars. Scientists are studying the results of the scientific experiments done by the rovers on the soil and rock as well as all of the images returned to Earth.

The Mars Exploration Program is a long term project involving spacecraft and technologies to continue researching Mars and preparing for the possible human expedition to the planet. By investigating the results sent back by all of the previous spacecraft and rovers, scientists have learned that Mars is home to volcanoes that are from 10-100 times larger than those on Earth.

They have studied the geology to recognize that the crust on Mars doesn’t move like the tectonic plates on Earth and the lava from the volcanos on Mars just reaches the surface and piles up on top of previous layers. The largest volcano in the solar system is found on Mars.
